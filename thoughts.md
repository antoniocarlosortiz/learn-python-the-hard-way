### Thougts on the Book

##### Appendix A: A Command Line Crash Course
Most of them I've come across already, but I'm glad to know about pushd and popd!

##### Exercise 0: The Setup
Quick startup. I'll still stick to Sublime Text 2 as my text editor instead of TextWrangler the author is suggesting.

##### Exercise 1: A Good First Program
It's a very simple exercise on the print function- just print stuff!

##### Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
Another simple exercise. I learned that reading code backwards could be helpful. Nice.

##### Exercise 3: Numbers and Math
Pretty self-explanatory when you know basic math and how to print strings. Comma is important after the string when joining strings with other types such as integers.

##### Exercise 4: Variables and Names
Good reminder- not all operands have to be floating point numbers for the answer to be a floating point.

##### Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing
I've used these before. For height_in_cm, the answer produces too many decimal places (6 to be exact) even when the numerator is an integer and the denominator only has 2 decimal places. Interesting.

##### Exercise 6: Strings and Text
%r will come in pretty handy for debugging.

##### Exercise 7: More Printing
Learned the comma trick for joining two strings with space between them.

###### So far... 
Very basic stuff! I've come across them before, but I learned some new things I could use for better code/debugging in the future, which is cool.
